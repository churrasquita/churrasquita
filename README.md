I'm a second-year Civil Engineer student specializing in Computer Science from Chile, passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my knowledge every day. I have experience with Python and a foundational knowledge of Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

I value collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning, and I am always eager to take on challenges that help me grow both academically and personally. My goal is to combine my technical skills with a strong work ethic to create solutions that make a positive impact.

- Outside of tech, I enjoy watching films 📖, painting 🖌️, listening to music 🎵, and going to the gym 💪.
